==> Options
--with-jemalloc
	Select jemalloc as memory allocator when building Redis
--HEAD
	Install HEAD version
==> Caveats
To have launchd start redis at login:
  ln -sfv /usr/local/opt/redis/*.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents
Then to load redis now:
  launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.redis.plist
Or, if you don't want/need launchctl, you can just run:
  redis-server /usr/local/etc/redis.conf
